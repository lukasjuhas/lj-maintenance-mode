## Description

As a web developer working with Wordpress almost every day, very often I came across problem that If I wanted simple maintenance plugin to do some updates on my or client's website, I came across all these useless and overcomplicated plugins until I decided that I'll make one myself which will be the one I'll be confident and happy to use with ease.

Maintenance Mode is very simple and it's using Wordpress's wp_die() function which is core function of Wordpress, which makes this plugin feel and work as a part of Wordpress core. There is settings page under "Settings" in the main wp-admin menu where you can enable maintenance mode or change content using WYSIWYG editor so you can also add pictures, links etc. When activated and logged in as admin, you can see website as usual, rest of the users / visitors can see maintenance mode. You can see the maintenance mode as admin in preview mode using preview link on the settings page or simply open website in private mode or different browser to double check if it's enabled and working. There is also indicator in admin bar that changes colour to red when maintenance mode is enabled.

Help support and translate this plugin!

## Installation

1. Upload `lj-maintenance-mode` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Navigate to Settings -> Maintenance Mode  or simply click on Admin Bar indicator for settings to enable maintenance mode.

## FAQ
1. Is this plugin really ad free ?<br>
Yes.

2. Can I change colours?<br>
Not by default. Unless you are developer and you "inject" your own styles in to the wp_die() page.

3. Plugin doesn't seem to work. What should I do ?<br>
First, if you are using Cache plugin such as WP Super Cache or W3 Total Cache, flush all your cache. Secondly, disable all other plugins and try enabling just Maintenance Mode and see if problem persist. This should solve most common problems. If not, don't hesitate to contact me via Support button from Settings page
